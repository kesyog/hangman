# hangman ⚖️

A WIP Bluetooth-enabled crane scale that aims to be compatible with the custom [Tindeq Progressor
Bluetooth service][API] and can be used with compatible tools. 

The firmware is based around [Embassy][Embassy], an embedded async framework written in Rust, and
currently runs on an Nordic nRF52840.

## Status

It works with the Tindeq mobile app but is still a functionally-incomplete mess of hacks in need of
more documentation and cleanup. Stay tuned!

Someday you should be able to use it to make a cheap DIY strength/climbing training tool.

## Disclaimer

This is not an officially supported Google product. Wouldn't that be funny though?

This has no affiliation with Tindeq.
